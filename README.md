# Reach Technical Test - Manchester Codes

This is a technical test as part of Manchester Codes' Front End module using React. 

Based on a short brief, the objective of this task was to build a React web app that allows users to search for images that were returned from a query to NASA image API.

This project uses:

- React Testing Library
- Jest for testing
- Axios for retrieving data from the API
- PropTypes to validate props
